This code implements a Grid World Value Iteration algorithm to solve a simple reinforcement learning environment. The grid world environment consists of states represented as cells in a 2D grid. This environment consists of a starting state, and a goal state and obstacles. The objective is for an agent to find the optimal policy that leads it from the starting state to the goal state while maximizing the cumulative reward.

At the end, the code produces a visualization of the grid that contains:

- Grid world layout with obstacles, start, and goal states.
- Value function for each state, representing the expected reward from each cell.
- Optimal policy that shows the best action for each state.
Below are the steps you need to perform before running the code. 

- Install the Python libraries required to run the program.

To install, run the command pip install -r requirements.txt in the code editor terminal. This step will install all the required libraries. Make sure you run this code in the folder with the script and requirements file.


Before running the code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed.


To run the code, execute the python file (HW1_code.py) in any of the code compilers. We have used visual studio and Jupyter notebook. However, this can be done by any of the code compilers with Python.
